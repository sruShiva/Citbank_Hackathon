4. report.html

# Contents
NSE_200.ipynb - This file contains the code for Data Analytics on the different csv files from Bhavcopy.zip and other csv files
along with the various plots.

NSE_200.docx - This file contains the data analytics performed on Excel. It contains the graphs of various results obtained while doing the analysis.

Citibank_report_code- This file contains the code for the report made on html.

# Assumptions made:

The analysis done is for a particular day. Whereas this can be replicated for all the days by running the code everyday at a fixed time using windows scheduler.
The target customers can be both the institutions as well as a consumer. We have used two different tools to look at a variety of different results and tried to 
analyse each part as much as possible. Some inbuilt APIS have been used to make the process faster.
